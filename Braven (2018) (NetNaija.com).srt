00:04:47,794 --> 00:04:50,363
- That's the last of the load?
- Yup.

3
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:58,604
Alright. We're good!

4
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,143
- Ho-ho.
- Hey, Joe, I'm on a break.

5
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:06,410
Break, huh?

6
00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:07,845
Yeah. You ever heard
of one of those?

7
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:09,679
No.

8
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:11,515
Storm's coming.

9
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:12,816
Take the load in the morning.
Stay in town tonight.

10
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:14,619
No. I'll be all right.

11
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:18,222
I gotta be back by tomorrow
and take care of some shit.

12
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:19,756
Okay.

13
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:22,160
- You got chains?
- Yeah, I got chains.

14
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:24,195
If you get caught, you make sure
you chain up for S-curves.

15
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:26,330
What is this, orientation?
I got it.

16
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:28,599
Besides, if it gets
a little gnarly on the pass,

17
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,568
I'll just bunk at your cabin.

18
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,835
You leave now, you'll make it.

19
00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:34,438
You stay the fuck away
from my cabin.

20
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,840
Drive safe, partner.

21
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:37,510
Always do, man.

22
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:08,775
Hey!

23
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,683
Dad! How'd you know
I was up here?

24
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:20,618
'Cause the birds told me,
that's why.

25
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,722
They started chirping 'cause
I was too close to their nest.

26
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:26,323
Mwah.

27
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:28,693
They tell you
that was coming, huh?

28
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,760
- Full moon.
- No, no, no, no, don't!

29
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:32,597
Stop!

30
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:33,931
- Did you miss me, babe?
- Yeah.

31
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:35,532
It's been like
three whole days.

32
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:36,700
It was five days, honey.

33
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:37,969
Charlotte get her.
Save Mom!

34
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,236
Stop!

35
00:06:39,238 --> 00:06:41,505
Get off of me.

36
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:42,939
No, don't you dare!

37
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:45,542
You better give me kisses.
Give me a kiss.

38
00:06:45,544 --> 00:06:48,679
Soup's on the stove.
Come here. Give me a kiss.

39
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:49,914
Mwah.

40
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,648
See you tonight.

41
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,749
Okay.

42
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:54,318
I'll see you tonight.

43
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,919
If you're even up
by the time I get home,

44
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:58,422
- I'll consider that foreplay.
- Uh-oh, what is that?

45
00:06:58,424 --> 00:06:59,789
I don't know
what she's talking about.

46
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,359
Where's your grandpa?

47
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:03,027
Oh, putting up Christmas lights.
Back there.

48
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:04,729
Oh, yeah, Christmas lights.

49
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:07,832
That was a real adventure.
He's in the garage.

50
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,467
Good luck with that.

51
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:10,467
All right.

52
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:12,570
You go make me some soup.

53
00:07:12,572 --> 00:07:14,972
Charlotte, you want
a little brother?

54
00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:18,475
Mrs. Braven, see you tonight.

55
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:20,311
Yeah.

56
00:07:20,313 --> 00:07:21,746
Ha ha ha!

57
00:07:21,748 --> 00:07:25,650
When I get home, Joe Braven,
when I get home...

58
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:28,387
I love you.

59
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:34,792
Hey, Pops.

60
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:35,829
Hey.

61
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:39,665
What are you doing?

62
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:45,568
I came out here
to find something.

63
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,539
Christmas lights.

64
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:50,009
Right here, Dad.

65
00:07:51,077 --> 00:07:53,943
Oh. I thought they'd...

66
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:56,414
Well, they should be up here.

67
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,316
Put things
in their proper place.

68
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:00,717
You always put things
where they're supposed to be.

69
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:02,453
I'm working on it. Cheers.

70
00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:07,390
What is this?

71
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:09,029
It's a porter.

72
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:12,530
Tastes like a shit milk shake.

73
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:15,469
Dinner's ready. Let's go.

74
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:30,783
Daddy?

75
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:33,850
Yeah.

76
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:35,955
You were asleep again.

77
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:40,523
- No.
- Uh-huh.

78
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:41,792
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah.

79
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:43,360
You calling me a liar?

80
00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:44,695
- Stop!
- Huh?

81
00:08:44,697 --> 00:08:46,763
You always fall asleep.

82
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:48,766
That's 'cause
it's time for bed.

83
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,137
There's Piggy.

84
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:55,973
But you didn't even
finish the story.

85
00:08:55,975 --> 00:08:58,712
- Really?
- Yes, really.

86
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,681
All right, where were we?

87
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:05,816
"The forest animals
play hide and seek.

88
00:09:05,818 --> 00:09:08,451
Bethany Bear hides in her cave.

89
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:10,921
She falls asleep,
and her friends can't find her.

90
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:13,724
Winter turns to spring.

91
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:15,759
And she's crowned the best
hide and seek champion

92
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:16,960
in the whole forest."

93
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:19,162
The end.

94
00:09:19,164 --> 00:09:20,730
Boop.

95
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,572
Stop!

96
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:31,474
Good night, pig.

97
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:33,411
Don't do that again.

98
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:35,745
- I love you.
- I love you too.

99
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:37,547
Oh, I finished
Grandpa's bracelet.

100
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,582
Can I give it to him?

101
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:43,553
He's probably asleep, honey,
just like you should be.

102
00:09:43,555 --> 00:09:46,058
We'll give it to him tomorrow.
Turn the light out.

103
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,068
I love you.

104
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:07,744
Pops?

105
00:11:07,673 --> 00:11:10,110
Oh, Jesus, not again.

106
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:12,712
Hey, Pops.

107
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:22,619
Hello?

108
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:25,288
Joe, hey, it's Mike
from the Trinity Bar.

109
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,292
Yeah, listen,
you better get over here.

110
00:11:28,294 --> 00:11:29,926
Yeah, your dad's here again.

111
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:31,095
Excuse me?

112
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:33,830
Time for us to go home.

113
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:35,065
Let go.

114
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,099
- Come on, baby.
- I don't...

115
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:37,100
Hey!

116
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:38,801
- Joe!
- I got it.

117
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:39,802
I'm on my way.

118
00:11:39,804 --> 00:11:40,870
<i>Linden, no!</i>

119
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:43,139
Hey, what's going on?

120
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:44,707
Dad's at the Trinity again.

121
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:45,945
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

122
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:38,030
You okay?

123
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:46,769
No, no, I understand.

124
00:12:46,771 --> 00:12:50,173
Yeah, I understand.
Okay, thanks, Harris.

125
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:53,109
Guy he got into it with is on
parole for aggravated assault,

126
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:56,680
so he doesn't want
to press charges, but...

127
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:59,215
we got a problem, Joe.

128
00:12:59,217 --> 00:13:03,921
It kills me to see
your father this way,

129
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:06,657
but this happens again,
I'm gonna have to arrest him.

130
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:08,825
And you too.

131
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:11,063
Yeah, I got it.

132
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:17,835
We finished stitching him up
'cause it was a head injury.

133
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:19,737
Daddy!

134
00:13:19,739 --> 00:13:20,970
Hello, pumpkin.

135
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:23,373
Daddy, what happened
to your face?

136
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,243
I was wrestling with Grandpa.

137
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:28,811
- How's he doing?
- We finished stitching him up.

138
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:31,217
- Go check on Grandpa, okay?
- Okay.

139
00:13:33,952 --> 00:13:36,220
'Cause it was a head injury,
I ordered the MRI.

140
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,754
- How's it look?
- It looked okay,

141
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:39,156
but how'd he get in a fight?

142
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:40,957
He thought a woman at the bar
was his wife.

143
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,859
It was my fault. I was
supposed to be watching him.

144
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:45,796
Is he alone
when you two are at work?

145
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:49,298
I mean, I schedule my lessons
to work around Joe being gone,

146
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,069
but sometimes things come up.

147
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:53,903
Well, since your father's
accident last year,

148
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:55,406
his mental condition
is getting worse.

149
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:57,340
Let me talk to another
neurologist, okay?

150
00:13:57,342 --> 00:13:59,243
- He'll do a complete scan.
- No, we're done with that.

151
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:01,811
Then I suggest you consider
a much more supervised approach.

152
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:03,413
I'm not putting my dad
in the home.

153
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:05,449
Look, that's not
the only option.

154
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:08,152
Is he ready to go?

155
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:11,220
Just think about it, Joe.

156
00:14:11,222 --> 00:14:12,257
Yeah.

157
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:25,301
All right, baby girl.

158
00:14:25,303 --> 00:14:27,403
Let's get you home,
get you to bed.

159
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:28,875
Okay.

160
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,712
Bye, Dad.

161
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:36,882
- See you at home.
- Yeah.

162
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:40,787
That's, uh...

163
00:14:44,723 --> 00:14:47,490
Donny's girl.

164
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:49,061
Right?

165
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:52,966
That's Charlotte, Dad.

166
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,135
That's your granddaughter.

167
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:01,805
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

168
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:04,811
Yeah, Charlotte, yeah.

169
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:12,184
Let's get you home, Pops, hmm?

170
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:22,254
You ready motherfucker, hmm?

171
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:31,228
Hey.

172
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,099
Don't you puss out on me, man.

173
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:09,899
So how often do you make
this run up north again?

174
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:12,336
About every two weeks.

175
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:15,138
Okay, any other drivers
that make this run?

176
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,407
We're not gonna involve
anyone else, man.

177
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:20,977
Why the fuck not? That's how
you branch out, move up.

178
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:23,914
There ain't nobody else you can
trust to bring on this deal?

179
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,215
It's not about trust, man.

180
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:27,050
I'm just not
involving anyone else.

181
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:28,886
That's why you're always
gonna stay a fucking runner.

182
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:31,221
That's fine, man.
I'm just gonna collect my money.

183
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:33,657
Hold on!

184
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:35,458
What the fuck?!

185
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:38,597
Jesus Christ.

186
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,069
What the fuck, man?

187
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:46,372
Damn it.

188
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:58,251
What the fuck?

189
00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:01,651
Oh, Jesus Christ.

190
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:03,320
What the fuck is wrong with you?

191
00:18:03,322 --> 00:18:06,089
All you had to do was drive
the fucking truck, man!

192
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:07,390
We gotta get this shit
out of here

193
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:09,059
before somebody comes, man.

194
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:11,965
Fuck. Go get my bag
and the ax.

195
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:24,509
Fuck!

196
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:29,245
- Where is it?
- Right here, right here.

197
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,080
Give me the fucking flashlight.

198
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:33,417
- Right here?
- Crack that fucker open.

199
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:34,517
There you go.

200
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:43,292
- That's my truck, man!
- Holy shit.

201
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:44,528
That's my fucking truck!

202
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,629
Relax.
Open the fucking log.

203
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:49,265
Dude, just get back here.
Hurry up.

204
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:55,472
Jesus, that's a lotta dope.

205
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:57,139
I know. Kinda makes you hard,
don't it?

206
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:58,742
Come on.
Load the fucking bag up.

207
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:02,247
- Here, take it out of the bag.
- Oh, fuck.

208
00:19:04,248 --> 00:19:05,514
Fuck.

209
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:08,187
Fuck. We need to
extinguish this, man.

210
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:12,356
We gotta get rid of the dope
before the cops come.

211
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:14,023
Just get it in the bag.

212
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:16,193
Dude, just figure out
where we're gonna go.

213
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:17,660
All right.

214
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:20,097
We're not too far
from my boss' cabin.

215
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:22,733
It's a couple miles up the road.
We'll stash it there.

216
00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:24,670
All right, let's go.

217
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:13,783
Honey, what are you doing?

218
00:20:13,785 --> 00:20:15,519
It's almost
one in the morning.

219
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:17,821
I'm almost done.
Go back inside.

220
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:19,292
Joe.

221
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:24,327
Look at me.

222
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:25,598
Hey.

223
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:34,407
I don't wanna put my dad
in a home.

224
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:52,358
He's the strongest man
I've ever known.

225
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:56,128
Now look at him.

226
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:04,037
I don't want Charlotte
seeing him like that.

227
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:11,076
I know.

228
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:14,414
But we're a family.

229
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:18,650
Okay?

230
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:22,721
And we will
make it through this.

231
00:21:24,622 --> 00:21:28,126
Maybe this doesn't have
to be our decision alone.

232
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:32,665
You can talk to your dad.

233
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:37,199
Take him to the cabin.

234
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:40,270
Just you and him.

235
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:42,542
You know he loves it there.

236
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:47,646
Just get the conversation
started.

237
00:21:51,682 --> 00:21:52,651
Hey.

238
00:22:25,316 --> 00:22:28,186
- All right, this is it.
- Thank God.

239
00:22:42,534 --> 00:22:44,367
You sure it's good here?

240
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:46,405
Yeah. Joe's not
coming up here, man.

241
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:51,143
Oh, fuck.

242
00:22:57,448 --> 00:22:58,583
All right.

243
00:23:03,554 --> 00:23:05,358
Come on, man,
hurry up.

244
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:10,961
It's cold as shit up here.

245
00:23:10,963 --> 00:23:12,265
Here.

246
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:17,900
All right, good, man.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

247
00:23:17,902 --> 00:23:19,769
Fuck.

248
00:23:19,771 --> 00:23:21,370
Dude, I'm freezing.

249
00:23:21,372 --> 00:23:23,406
Just fucking take it
if you're fucking cold.

250
00:23:23,408 --> 00:23:24,506
Dude, I'm trying
to share with you.

251
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:25,809
Take the fucking blanket, man.

252
00:23:26,978 --> 00:23:28,445
Stay here.

253
00:23:28,447 --> 00:23:29,782
Thank God.

254
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,286
Shit.

255
00:23:37,288 --> 00:23:40,357
It's okay. Relax.
Don't worry about.

256
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:46,463
Thank you, sir!

257
00:23:46,465 --> 00:23:48,298
You stupid motherfucker.

258
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,898
This is really funny
to you, huh?

259
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,834
That shit on the side
of the road, that's my life.

260
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:53,637
You should be worried
about Kassen.

261
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:56,742
I gotta make the call,
so shut the fuck up about it.

262
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:16,461
What's up, Kassen?

263
00:24:18,964 --> 00:24:20,897
Are you hungry?

264
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:23,502
Pancakes here ain't half bad.

265
00:24:27,406 --> 00:24:32,509
Look, I know that I fucked up,

266
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:35,447
but I'll make
this thing right.

267
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:41,720
Please give me the chance.

268
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,625
Fuck.

269
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,809
What?

270
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:07,644
<i>Slight hiccup.</i>

271
00:25:07,646 --> 00:25:09,012
<i>I don't have it with me.</i>

272
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:10,780
Oh, no.

273
00:25:10,782 --> 00:25:14,451
<i>But I got the whole load.
Check this out, man.</i>

274
00:25:14,453 --> 00:25:16,653
I know you wanted me to spread
this out over several runs,

275
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:20,523
but I got this whole
motherfucking thing in one trip.

276
00:25:20,525 --> 00:25:22,524
Genius.

277
00:25:22,526 --> 00:25:24,526
Where is it?

278
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:26,495
<i>It's over the border, man.
We got it stashed.</i>

279
00:25:26,497 --> 00:25:28,398
It's all good.

280
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,867
Slight hiccup is that
we flipped the truck,

281
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:32,435
<i>and the cops came.</i>

282
00:25:32,437 --> 00:25:34,103
<i>I got my boy Pete
coming after it.</i>

283
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:37,139
Don't worry about it.
It's all good, all right?

284
00:25:37,141 --> 00:25:39,408
<i>You tell Pete to stay home.</i>

285
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,878
- I'm coming.
- You can't smoke that in here.

286
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,746
- I'll get him to put it out.
- Where the fuck are you?

287
00:25:43,748 --> 00:25:45,715
- It's okay.
- <i>Some fucking shitty hotel.</i>

288
00:25:45,717 --> 00:25:47,716
- Sir!
- It's okay, ma'am. I got it.

289
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:49,785
<i>Where we at, Weston?</i>

290
00:25:49,787 --> 00:25:51,955
Greenwood Inn, room eight.

291
00:25:51,957 --> 00:25:54,493
We're at the Greenwood Inn,
room eight.

292
00:25:58,429 --> 00:25:59,431
Fuck.

293
00:26:01,632 --> 00:26:03,768
Put it out, dickhead.

294
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:06,671
Dickhead.

295
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:16,948
This is gonna hurt.

296
00:26:51,483 --> 00:26:54,783
Morning.

297
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:56,453
Hey, Dad.

298
00:26:56,455 --> 00:26:58,655
Morning, Grandpa.

299
00:26:58,657 --> 00:26:59,755
Hey!

300
00:26:59,757 --> 00:27:01,590
Look at you.

301
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:03,693
- Hey, you make that for me?
- Yeah.

302
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:05,195
Thank you.

303
00:27:05,197 --> 00:27:06,763
Hey, Pop, how you feeling today?

304
00:27:06,765 --> 00:27:09,198
I'm good. I feel good.

305
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,836
Hey, I'm feeling like
I'm ready to go back to work.

306
00:27:12,838 --> 00:27:15,538
I think you need to take
the day off, Dad, okay?

307
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,674
I was thinking maybe
we'd go up to the cabin.

308
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:18,711
Cabin? What for?

309
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,612
Well, you can help me
shut it down for the winter.

310
00:27:23,614 --> 00:27:25,915
That's the first time
your old man

311
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:28,784
ever asked for my help
with anything.

312
00:27:28,786 --> 00:27:31,654
All right, I'll go.

313
00:27:31,656 --> 00:27:33,022
I wanna go. Please?

314
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:34,224
Hey, I'll take you hunting.

315
00:27:34,226 --> 00:27:36,259
Maybe I can fix
one of those bad habits

316
00:27:36,261 --> 00:27:38,994
you're picking up
from your dad.

317
00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:41,731
You know what? Actually,
I don't have to work today,

318
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:43,800
so I need your help
around here.

319
00:27:43,802 --> 00:27:45,667
Oh, Mommy, please?

320
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:48,137
Don't give me that look.
No, ma'am.

321
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:49,805
Don't look at me.

322
00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:51,707
Dad, I never see you.

323
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:53,141
Charlotte, listen to me.
I owe you, okay, baby?

324
00:27:53,143 --> 00:27:54,511
I promise I'll take you
next time.

325
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:56,612
You always say that.

326
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:58,049
She's yours.

327
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,850
Listen, I got everything
packed up,

328
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:03,520
so you wanna
grab your stuff?

329
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:07,092
All right. You mind
if I eat an egg first?

330
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:18,600
I'll drive.

331
00:28:18,602 --> 00:28:21,303
I got it, Pops, I got it.

332
00:28:21,305 --> 00:28:22,507
All right.

333
00:28:30,582 --> 00:28:32,051
Get comfy, old man.

334
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,009
Shit.

335
00:30:46,383 --> 00:30:48,120
Ah.

336
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:51,255
- Hey.
- Hey.

337
00:30:54,426 --> 00:30:56,729
Goddamn! You get off
on this shit, huh?

338
00:30:58,063 --> 00:30:59,962
Nice G.I. Joe gear, boy.

339
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:01,697
Who's your friend?

340
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:03,699
This is Weston, man.
He's gonna lead the way.

341
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:05,167
Okay.

342
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:06,869
Why don't you
ride with Gentry?

343
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:09,108
You can ride with us, Weston.

344
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:12,410
Gentlemen!

345
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:18,684
Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy, man.

346
00:31:19,784 --> 00:31:21,754
Hey, what's up, man?

347
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:25,990
How you doing?

348
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:37,966
Good.

349
00:31:37,968 --> 00:31:40,302
We got power.

350
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:43,374
We'll get those curtains open,
let some light in.

351
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,501
Somebody left the crib
half empty.

352
00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:13,235
Wanna bring in some timber?

353
00:32:13,237 --> 00:32:14,273
Yep.

354
00:32:29,353 --> 00:32:30,288
There you go.

355
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:34,823
Can I talk to you
for a second, Dad?

356
00:32:34,825 --> 00:32:37,326
Why don't you get
the coffee going?

357
00:32:37,328 --> 00:32:41,062
Yeah, yeah, just a minute.

358
00:32:41,064 --> 00:32:43,000
Can I ask you something?

359
00:32:51,342 --> 00:32:54,979
You remember what happened
last night at the bar?

360
00:32:57,247 --> 00:33:00,015
I had a disagreement,
wound up with 11 stitches.

361
00:33:00,017 --> 00:33:02,851
Yeah, I remember.

362
00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:05,554
You grabbed a woman by the arm
and tried to pull her out.

363
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:08,293
They said you thought
she was Mom.

364
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:12,497
Nah. I don't think so.

365
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:18,600
Do you remember seeing
Charlotte at the hospital?

366
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:22,972
Hey, what is this, huh?
What are you doing?

367
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:25,144
What are these questions?

368
00:33:27,011 --> 00:33:30,378
The doctor thinks you need
a different kind of supervision.

369
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:34,917
I need to be supervised?

370
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:37,086
No, but when you go off
and do stuff that...

371
00:33:37,088 --> 00:33:40,523
What else does the doctor think?

372
00:33:40,525 --> 00:33:43,525
I need to be put somewhere,
maybe put in a home, huh?

373
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:45,427
No, we're not
doing that, okay?

374
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:47,263
But we gotta talk about
something else that we can do.

375
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:49,398
Oh, we do, huh?
Let me tell you something.

376
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,068
When my old man
gave me the mill,

377
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,636
he didn't have to because
he could still get it done,

378
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:54,936
and so could I.

379
00:33:54,938 --> 00:33:56,371
I didn't put him out to pasture.

380
00:33:56,373 --> 00:33:58,040
I didn't put him
in some goddamn home

381
00:33:58,042 --> 00:33:59,442
with a bunch of drooling,
bedwetting old bastards.

382
00:33:59,444 --> 00:34:00,976
I'm not gonna
put you in a home.

383
00:34:00,978 --> 00:34:03,512
You're goddamn right
you're not!

384
00:34:03,514 --> 00:34:05,117
Pops...

385
00:34:06,484 --> 00:34:07,586
Yeah.

386
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:12,088
I forget some things now,
all right?

387
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,390
Hey, why don't you try
falling 40 feet

388
00:34:15,392 --> 00:34:17,894
with nothing
but a helicopter dash

389
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:19,461
to break your fall?

390
00:34:19,463 --> 00:34:22,365
See how you wind up, huh?

391
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:24,499
Hot shot.

392
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:27,669
Pops, I don't wanna fight.
I just wanna talk.

393
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:29,338
Yeah?

394
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,077
Is it working out the way
you thought it would?

395
00:34:33,378 --> 00:34:35,247
Goddamn it.

396
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:19,557
Shit.
Stop right here.

397
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:30,501
Ah, shit.

398
00:35:34,972 --> 00:35:36,474
Uh, I think, uh...

399
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:40,041
I think Joe
might be up here, man.

400
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:41,410
Dude, what the fuck
are you talking about?

401
00:35:41,412 --> 00:35:43,211
You said the bag
would be safe.

402
00:35:43,213 --> 00:35:44,482
All right.

403
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:48,483
Any other roads out of here?

404
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:51,253
No, this is the only one.
There's ATV trails

405
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:53,122
that go to the back ravines
and Blue Mountain,

406
00:35:53,124 --> 00:35:54,557
but this is the only road.

407
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,624
The cabin's about
a half-mile away.

408
00:35:56,626 --> 00:35:58,059
Cell service?

409
00:35:58,061 --> 00:36:00,363
Not up here.

410
00:36:00,365 --> 00:36:03,298
Except for maybe up
on Blue Mountain.

411
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,734
All right, we're gonna secure
the road 150 yards out.

412
00:36:05,736 --> 00:36:08,370
Clay, Louisi,
take the east side of the road.

413
00:36:08,372 --> 00:36:11,573
Ridley, Essington,
you take the west of the road.

414
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:13,075
We're gonna flank him.
Gear up.

415
00:36:13,077 --> 00:36:15,644
Yo, G.I. Joe,
let me get one of those.

416
00:36:15,646 --> 00:36:17,245
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

417
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:20,048
Look, I know this guy.
Let me talk to him.

418
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,318
- What is this, man?
- Talk to him, motherfucker?

419
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,653
We just need to go back in there
and get our shit.

420
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:27,756
Anyone who hasn't royally
fucked up in the last 24 hours,

421
00:36:27,758 --> 00:36:29,524
raise your hand.

422
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:32,128
Shut the fuck up
and do as you're told.

423
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,365
Hit it.

424
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,198
What the...

425
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,586
Latch is busted.

426
00:37:31,722 --> 00:37:34,126
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

427
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,126
Yeah.

428
00:37:38,128 --> 00:37:39,829
There's tracks out there.

429
00:37:39,831 --> 00:37:41,166
Footprints...

430
00:37:43,101 --> 00:37:44,736
...around here.

431
00:37:50,508 --> 00:37:51,707
Hi, Daddy.

432
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:54,178
Charlotte, what are you
doing here?

433
00:37:55,512 --> 00:37:57,879
Does your mother know
where you are?

434
00:37:57,881 --> 00:37:59,682
I left her a note.

435
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:01,383
Were you in the back
of my truck?

436
00:38:01,385 --> 00:38:04,687
- Yeah.
- Baby, you're a rascal.

437
00:38:04,689 --> 00:38:05,791
Pops, let's go!

438
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:14,296
Is everyone in position?

439
00:38:14,298 --> 00:38:15,865
Not yet.

440
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:17,202
Almost.

441
00:38:24,142 --> 00:38:26,575
Dad, I'm sorry.

442
00:38:26,577 --> 00:38:28,180
Get in the car.

443
00:39:09,753 --> 00:39:12,254
Another male rides shotgun.

444
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:13,725
<i>Take 'em both out.</i>

445
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:34,776
What?

446
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:36,213
Something's not right.

447
00:39:41,852 --> 00:39:43,455
Come on.

448
00:39:44,588 --> 00:39:46,357
Baby, get down, get down.

449
00:39:52,762 --> 00:39:54,231
No shot.

450
00:39:55,865 --> 00:39:58,267
Let's move to the perimeter
of the cabin.

451
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:00,336
<i>Essington,
take the back east corner.</i>

452
00:40:00,338 --> 00:40:02,771
<i>Louisi, front east.</i>

453
00:40:02,773 --> 00:40:04,807
<i>Ridley, you'll take
the front west.</i>

454
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:06,608
<i>And, Clay, take the rear west.</i>

455
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,811
Let me know when
you're each in position.

456
00:40:08,813 --> 00:40:10,479
Let's go.

457
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:12,551
You can ride
in the big boy's seat.

458
00:40:13,684 --> 00:40:15,287
Fuck, man.

459
00:40:35,972 --> 00:40:38,474
- Close the curtains, Pops.
- What's going on?

460
00:40:38,476 --> 00:40:41,412
It's gonna be all right, baby.
It's gonna be all right.

461
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,582
Daddy?

462
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:49,653
It's gonna be okay,
baby, okay?

463
00:40:58,863 --> 00:41:01,597
- The CB is in the shed.
- You good to shoot?

464
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,301
What do you think?

465
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:07,870
- Dad?
- It's gonna be okay, baby.

466
00:41:07,872 --> 00:41:09,872
Grandpa and I gotta do
a few things, all right?

467
00:41:09,874 --> 00:41:12,244
- I can help.
- Help by staying out of sight.

468
00:41:16,914 --> 00:41:18,946
It is very important that
you do not open this door

469
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:19,981
unless it's for me, okay?

470
00:41:19,983 --> 00:41:21,716
- Okay.
- All right, baby.

471
00:41:21,718 --> 00:41:23,619
Get in there.

472
00:41:23,621 --> 00:41:24,956
Okay, I love you.

473
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:54,686
Ehh.

474
00:41:56,419 --> 00:41:58,986
Once you're in position,
check in.

475
00:41:58,988 --> 00:42:00,622
<i>Copy. Rear east.</i>

476
00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:02,624
<i>I got rear west.</i>

477
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:03,691
<i>Copy. Front west.</i>

478
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:05,561
<i>Roger. Rear east.</i>

479
00:42:05,563 --> 00:42:07,965
<i>Hold your positions
until the bag is secure.</i>

480
00:42:44,735 --> 00:42:46,968
This is Joe Braven up on
Blue Mountain. Does anyone copy?

481
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:52,039
This is Joe Braven on
Blue Mountain. Do you copy?

482
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:54,443
<i>This is Fish and Game.
Go ahead, Joe.</i>

483
00:42:54,445 --> 00:42:56,581
This is Joe Braven.

484
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,137
Come on, man.
Why we standing around?

485
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:25,376
Give me a gun. I'll go in there
and get it myself.

486
00:43:27,878 --> 00:43:30,479
Do you know this guy?

487
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:31,850
Yeah, man.

488
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:35,053
Tell me about him.

489
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:40,222
How many of them?

490
00:43:40,224 --> 00:43:42,660
I make four, at least.

491
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,996
But you need to see this.

492
00:43:53,637 --> 00:43:55,807
- Motherfucker.
- Yeah.

493
00:43:58,709 --> 00:44:00,075
What are you gonna do?

494
00:44:00,077 --> 00:44:02,577
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, no.

495
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:04,579
With that amount of drugs,
they're not here to talk.

496
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:08,051
They're gonna size you up,
take you out, then come for us.

497
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:12,023
I got an idea.

498
00:44:14,258 --> 00:44:15,894
Son of a bitch.

499
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:32,476
Hey, you know
what you're doing?

500
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,179
I think so, Pops.

501
00:44:36,847 --> 00:44:39,082
Why don't you
go bring him out?

502
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:43,184
Look, his family's in there.

503
00:44:43,186 --> 00:44:45,019
Let's just come back
for the shit, man.

504
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:47,555
Motherfucker's got our drugs.

505
00:44:47,557 --> 00:44:50,027
Just bring him out.

506
00:45:06,075 --> 00:45:07,276
He's coming out.

507
00:45:07,278 --> 00:45:09,046
Louisi, Ridley,
come in from behind.

508
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,019
Well, look at you.

509
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:20,725
I'm so sorry, man.

510
00:45:25,863 --> 00:45:28,062
Ah, Mr. Braven.

511
00:45:28,064 --> 00:45:30,034
Sorry to interrupt your day.

512
00:45:33,003 --> 00:45:35,106
Yeah.

513
00:45:41,778 --> 00:45:44,081
Where the fuck's
the rest of it?

514
00:45:48,285 --> 00:45:51,986
If you shoot me, my guys
will burn the other half.

515
00:45:51,988 --> 00:45:53,957
Okay.

516
00:45:56,126 --> 00:45:58,059
You clear off my property.

517
00:45:58,061 --> 00:46:00,963
I'll meet you in town
at the Waverlin Cafe in an hour.

518
00:46:00,965 --> 00:46:02,664
I'll bring the rest of it,
and you'll never see me again.

519
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:03,999
Oh, no, no, no, fuck that.

520
00:46:04,001 --> 00:46:06,167
You get your Sasquatch ass
back in there

521
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:08,003
and bring all of it out now,
motherfucker.

522
00:46:08,005 --> 00:46:11,807
No, Joe,
I don't wanna go into town.

523
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:13,941
A city boy like me
wouldn't be welcome there.

524
00:46:13,943 --> 00:46:19,784
And besides, what if I run
into Stephanie or Charlotte?

525
00:46:22,753 --> 00:46:25,754
I didn't come here
to kill good people.

526
00:46:25,756 --> 00:46:27,189
I just want
what belongs to me.

527
00:46:27,191 --> 00:46:29,127
Joe, just do
what they want and then...

528
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:35,664
So how 'bout you go inside,
get the rest of it,

529
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:37,899
and then we'll be on our way.

530
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:39,635
Could you do that for me, Joe?

531
00:46:39,637 --> 00:46:41,803
Please?

532
00:46:41,805 --> 00:46:43,675
Uh, yeah.

533
00:46:44,874 --> 00:46:46,177
Watch him.

534
00:47:15,372 --> 00:47:16,972
You know if you give
the other half,

535
00:47:16,974 --> 00:47:19,041
we're as good as dead.

536
00:47:19,043 --> 00:47:21,410
I got a sniper
in the front woods.

537
00:47:21,412 --> 00:47:23,348
I'd like to take him out.

538
00:47:24,414 --> 00:47:26,213
Not yet, Pops.

539
00:47:26,215 --> 00:47:27,816
We gotta get Charlotte
out of here,

540
00:47:27,818 --> 00:47:29,785
then I'll come back for you.

541
00:47:29,787 --> 00:47:32,189
Until then, just wait.

542
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:36,294
Roger that.

543
00:48:15,298 --> 00:48:17,332
Hi, baby. I got you.

544
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:19,337
You're doing so good.
Come on.

545
00:48:21,238 --> 00:48:23,738
It's gonna be okay,
all right?

546
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,240
Soon Grandpa and I are gonna
need your help, all right?

547
00:48:26,242 --> 00:48:28,910
- I'm ready.
- That's my tough little girl.

548
00:48:28,912 --> 00:48:30,848
You stay right here.
I'll be right back.

549
00:48:33,751 --> 00:48:35,416
You still got 'em?

550
00:48:35,418 --> 00:48:37,051
Yeah, I do.

551
00:48:37,053 --> 00:48:39,256
Wait for my signal.

552
00:48:55,338 --> 00:48:57,338
Once we have
the other half secured,

553
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,506
take 'em all out.

554
00:48:58,508 --> 00:49:00,307
<i>Copy that.</i>

555
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:01,712
Copy.

556
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,096
Yeah, yeah.

557
00:50:01,405 --> 00:50:02,372
He's got the bag!

558
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,275
Fuck!

559
00:50:07,477 --> 00:50:09,376
Goddamn it. You with me.

560
00:50:09,378 --> 00:50:12,012
Lay down some cover.
Second floor.

561
00:50:12,014 --> 00:50:13,180
God damn!

562
00:50:16,285 --> 00:50:18,486
Nobody gets out of that cabin.

563
00:50:18,488 --> 00:50:20,187
- Go!
- Oh, hell no!

564
00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:21,159
Hey!

565
00:50:23,126 --> 00:50:24,258
Hey!

566
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,029
Hey, I need a fucking gun!

567
00:50:31,968 --> 00:50:33,303
Fuck.

568
00:51:18,048 --> 00:51:19,414
Charlotte,
you remember the plan?

569
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:21,182
- Okay.
- Yeah?

570
00:51:21,184 --> 00:51:22,584
You get to the top,
you call Mama.

571
00:51:22,586 --> 00:51:24,519
- Yeah.
- I love you.

572
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:26,053
Go.

573
00:51:26,055 --> 00:51:27,425
Run, run.

574
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:33,296
Go!

575
00:52:29,418 --> 00:52:31,051
Stop.

576
00:52:31,053 --> 00:52:32,523
Kill the engine.

577
00:53:00,182 --> 00:53:02,383
Wait.

578
00:53:02,385 --> 00:53:07,454
The main road's that direction.
Why is he looping back around?

579
00:53:07,456 --> 00:53:09,323
- Ah...
- What's going on?

580
00:53:09,325 --> 00:53:13,164
He's not trying to run.
He's going back to the cabin.

581
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,765
I'm going uphill,
try to find a sniper position.

582
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:19,970
You push him back towards me.

583
00:53:26,742 --> 00:53:27,978
Charlotte!

584
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:32,615
Charlotte, come on, baby.

585
00:55:07,443 --> 00:55:08,411
Oh, shit!

586
00:55:10,881 --> 00:55:12,646
All right.

587
00:55:12,648 --> 00:55:14,249
<i>He's down on
your side of the gorge.</i>

588
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:16,287
<i>Secure the bag,
clean him up.</i>

589
00:56:09,972 --> 00:56:11,372
I got the bag.

590
00:56:11,374 --> 00:56:13,508
<i>And where's Braven?</i>

591
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:15,278
I'll find him.

592
00:56:33,997 --> 00:56:35,232
Kassen, Joe didn't...

593
00:56:36,566 --> 00:56:37,865
<i>Gentry, say again.</i>

594
00:56:37,867 --> 00:56:39,769
<i>Say again, Gentry.</i>

595
00:57:56,345 --> 00:57:57,879
Please pick up.

596
00:57:58,947 --> 00:58:00,314
- Joe.
- <i>Mom?</i>

597
00:58:00,316 --> 00:58:01,849
Charlotte?

598
00:58:01,851 --> 00:58:03,050
<i>Charlotte, you can't
run off like that.</i>

599
00:58:03,052 --> 00:58:05,320
Stop. Mom, there are men
shooting at us.

600
00:58:05,322 --> 00:58:07,488
- What did you say?
- <i>They're shooting.</i>

601
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:08,789
<i>I'll meet you
at the lookout boulder</i>

602
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:09,791
<i>on Blue Mountain.</i>

603
00:58:09,793 --> 00:58:12,026
Where are you? Hello?

604
00:58:12,028 --> 00:58:13,695
Charlotte, baby,
I'm losing you.

605
00:58:13,697 --> 00:58:15,530
Hello, hello?

606
00:58:19,068 --> 00:58:20,901
<i>If you'd like
to make a call...</i>

607
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:24,972
<i>If you'd like
to make a call...</i>

608
00:58:24,974 --> 00:58:26,376
Shit.

609
00:58:35,584 --> 00:58:36,983
Sheriff Ossler.

610
00:58:36,985 --> 00:58:39,787
<i>Hey, Cal?
This is Stephanie Braven.</i>

611
00:58:39,789 --> 00:58:41,756
Listen, Joe's up at
Blue Mountain.

612
00:58:41,758 --> 00:58:44,024
There seems to be
some sort of trouble.

613
00:58:44,026 --> 00:58:45,859
- Trouble?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

614
00:58:45,861 --> 00:58:47,894
<i>Charlotte called and said
there were men shooting.</i>

615
00:58:47,896 --> 00:58:49,963
I don't know.
Anyway, she lost reception.

616
00:58:49,965 --> 00:58:51,832
<i>I tried calling her back,
and I can't get through.</i>

617
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:53,734
All right,
we'll check it out.

618
00:58:53,736 --> 00:58:55,602
- I'm headed up there right now.
- <i>No, you're not.</i>

619
00:58:55,604 --> 00:58:56,704
We'll handle it.

620
00:58:56,706 --> 00:58:58,342
Just hurry, please.

621
00:59:00,642 --> 00:59:02,910
Dispatch, this is Ossler.

622
00:59:02,912 --> 00:59:04,845
Deputy Harris and I
are headed over to Blue Mountain

623
00:59:04,847 --> 00:59:05,847
to respond to a call.

624
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:06,948
Will advise when we arrive.

625
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,816
What's going on?

626
00:59:08,818 --> 00:59:10,984
Shots fired over at
the Braven cabin. Let's go.

627
00:59:10,986 --> 00:59:12,787
Man, look,
it's probably just some kids

628
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:16,560
who are shooting cans off
some fence posts or something.

629
00:59:42,184 --> 00:59:43,786
Fuck you, man.

630
00:59:55,164 --> 00:59:56,467
That's fucked.

631
01:00:11,847 --> 01:00:13,050
Shit.

632
01:00:15,151 --> 01:00:17,151
I think Joe's daughter
was in that cabin.

633
01:00:17,153 --> 01:00:20,086
<i>Ridley, get to the top
of the mountain.</i>

634
01:00:20,088 --> 01:00:23,393
<i>Kid's trying to call for help.</i>

635
01:01:07,135 --> 01:01:10,137
- Essington.
- <i>Copy.</i>

636
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:11,705
Move to the west side
of the cabin.

637
01:01:11,707 --> 01:01:13,073
<i>Take a cover position.</i>

638
01:01:13,075 --> 01:01:15,609
<i>Clay, take your position
near the back.</i>

639
01:01:15,611 --> 01:01:17,711
<i>I get my hands on this bag,</i>

640
01:01:17,713 --> 01:01:19,982
<i>we kill all these
sons of bitches.</i>

641
01:02:28,617 --> 01:02:30,718
Clay, bag was another decoy.

642
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,320
<i>He's headed towards you.</i>

643
01:02:32,322 --> 01:02:34,354
<i>You go east along the trail.
I'm coming.</i>

644
01:02:34,356 --> 01:02:36,125
<i>We'll flank him.</i>

645
01:02:45,834 --> 01:02:47,003
<i>Over.</i>

646
01:02:52,842 --> 01:02:54,374
<i>I'm trying to find it.</i>

647
01:02:54,376 --> 01:02:56,242
<i>Clay, find the ATV trail.</i>

648
01:02:56,244 --> 01:02:58,180
<i>He's coming back on that.</i>

649
01:03:00,115 --> 01:03:02,649
<i>The drugs are
still in the cabin.</i>

650
01:03:02,651 --> 01:03:05,051
<i>Essington, Hallett,
hold the perimeter.</i>

651
01:03:05,053 --> 01:03:06,954
<i>Do not engage.</i>

652
01:03:06,956 --> 01:03:10,057
<i>Do not give him any excuse
to burn those drugs.</i>

653
01:04:34,977 --> 01:04:35,912
Goddamn it!

654
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:51,024
You fucking missed me!

655
01:04:51,026 --> 01:04:52,258
Fuck!

656
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:55,296
I should just
fucking shoot him.

657
01:04:55,298 --> 01:04:58,164
You dumb fucking Indian.

658
01:04:58,166 --> 01:04:59,399
Whew!

659
01:04:59,401 --> 01:05:00,771
Fuck.

660
01:06:04,332 --> 01:06:05,802
Clay.

661
01:06:07,903 --> 01:06:10,306
- Clay, you see him yet?
- <i>Not yet.</i>

662
01:07:30,452 --> 01:07:33,354
- Come on.
- He's right there!

663
01:07:33,356 --> 01:07:34,323
Come on!

664
01:07:53,409 --> 01:07:56,075
<i>Essington,
Joe's coming.</i>

665
01:07:56,077 --> 01:07:59,079
<i>Move to the east side
of the cabin, near the trail.</i>

666
01:07:59,081 --> 01:08:01,347
<i>See if you can't get
a clean shot on that sniper.</i>

667
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:02,585
<i>Take him out.</i>

668
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,170
Goddamn bastard.

669
01:08:59,174 --> 01:09:00,110
Fuck.

670
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:02,445
No!

671
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,590
Ah, fuck!

672
01:09:15,357 --> 01:09:16,392
Pin him in!

673
01:09:20,295 --> 01:09:22,164
Dad! Dad!

674
01:09:33,642 --> 01:09:35,711
Dad! Dad!

675
01:09:42,617 --> 01:09:45,054
Dad, Dad, it's Joe.

676
01:09:46,522 --> 01:09:49,590
Dad, it's Joe.
It's Joe.

677
01:09:49,592 --> 01:09:52,392
Joe, Joe.

678
01:09:52,394 --> 01:09:53,362
Dad, it's me.

679
01:09:54,496 --> 01:09:56,396
Dad, you're Linden Braven.

680
01:09:56,398 --> 01:09:58,399
You're Linden Braven.

681
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:00,333
You're Linden Braven.

682
01:10:00,335 --> 01:10:02,235
I'm your son.
I'm your son.

683
01:10:02,237 --> 01:10:05,038
You're Linden Braven.
I'm your son. I'm your son.

684
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,606
Shh, Dad.

685
01:10:06,608 --> 01:10:08,178
Come on!

686
01:10:16,419 --> 01:10:18,819
We're getting out of here.
Come on.

687
01:10:18,821 --> 01:10:20,055
Come on, Dad.

688
01:10:24,192 --> 01:10:25,695
Come on, Pops.

689
01:10:27,329 --> 01:10:28,598
All right.

690
01:10:32,367 --> 01:10:34,501
That's it, Pops.
Come on, come on.

691
01:10:34,503 --> 01:10:36,473
I got you. Here.

692
01:10:40,776 --> 01:10:42,077
All right.

693
01:10:44,746 --> 01:10:46,180
Sit down, sit down,
sit down.

694
01:10:46,182 --> 01:10:48,617
Sit down, sit down.

695
01:10:50,486 --> 01:10:52,552
Pops, look at me.
Look at me.

696
01:10:52,554 --> 01:10:54,821
- I need you to wait here, okay?
- Okay.

697
01:10:54,823 --> 01:10:56,759
- Stay here.
- I'll come with you.

698
01:11:04,366 --> 01:11:07,668
All right, Pops,
I'll be right back.

699
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:09,239
- Joe.
- Stay here.

700
01:12:09,531 --> 01:12:10,766
No!

701
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:18,640
Charlotte!

702
01:12:35,657 --> 01:12:37,490
Charlotte, run!

703
01:12:37,492 --> 01:12:39,696
Go to the road!

704
01:13:02,817 --> 01:13:04,751
You take the side
and the front entrances.

705
01:13:04,753 --> 01:13:06,720
I'll go around the back.

706
01:13:06,722 --> 01:13:08,825
We're taking
this goddamn cabin now.

707
01:13:09,959 --> 01:13:11,361
Fuck.

708
01:15:00,501 --> 01:15:02,368
Hey, hey!

709
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:05,105
- Cal, stop. It's Charlotte.
- My mom and dad need help!

710
01:15:05,107 --> 01:15:07,407
There are men
chasing my mom and dad.

711
01:15:07,409 --> 01:15:08,874
- They're all over the cabin.
- Dispatch, this is 101.

712
01:15:08,876 --> 01:15:10,476
Please send available units

Dad?

720
01:17:09,897 --> 01:17:10,866
Dad!

721
01:17:12,601 --> 01:17:14,534
There he is.

722
01:17:14,536 --> 01:17:15,569
Let him go.

723
01:17:15,571 --> 01:17:16,770
Let him go!

724
01:17:16,772 --> 01:17:17,770
Drop the ax!

01:17:17,772 --> 01:17:19,038
Let him go.

You drop that fucking ax![

Just let him go.

01:17:29,084 --> 01:17:30,717
I'm sorry.

732
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,252
That's what I wanted
in the first place!

733
01:17:33,254 --> 01:17:35,888
Bring me another bag
of teddy bears? Fuck you!

734
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,923
Just let him go.
He doesn't know what's going on.

735
01:17:37,925 --> 01:17:39,693
He's sick. Please.

736
01:17:39,695 --> 01:17:41,595
Please just let him go.
Just let him go.

737
01:17:41,597 --> 01:17:43,262
- You did this.

740
01:17:48,103 --> 01:17:49,202

Hey.

Oh, God.

No.

756
01:19:13,789 --> 01:19:16,021
This is Cal.

I don't know.
I'll find her.

01:20:32,867 --> 01:20:35,935
I think the cops are here.
Go around this trail. Get 'em.
